I chose Ruby for the rest of the term.
I'm currently using Visual Studio Code, but I might switch to a different one, if I can find one
for free with better support for Ruby. As far as installation and getting it running, it was easy,
but much more involved than C# or Java. Mostle because I didn't do my research, and started with
Notepad++ instead of an actual IDE.

I think Ruby is higher level than C#, but honestly I don't know. I have not found any objective
measure of this. It is loosely typed. Ruby is both compiled and interpreted, depending on the
specific implementation and version.

I chose Ruby because it seemed interesting. I feel like it has a bit more of a personal touch
than C# or Java. Also, I like that primitive data types are treated as objects, and I can change
basic aspects of how the language behaves. I currently don't have a plan for what to make in it,
but I kind of want to make some graphing software, and maybe a simple game.

As far as tutorials go, I've already done Ruby in Twenty Minutes, from their website.
I intend to look into frameworks for developing desktop apps in Ruby, probably FXRuby, as it
seems to be the most consistently updated.
